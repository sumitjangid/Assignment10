1. Do you find the code to be simpler when using AngularJS? If so, how? If not, why?

Answer: Yes, It is simpler to use Angular JS. The Angular JS aims to simplify both the development and the testing of web applications by providing a framework for client-side model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. In Angular there is a need to create a single controller which will contain the logic of the main index.html page. Angular provides a structure for the journey of building an application from designing the user interface, through writing the business logic for testing. 



2. Would a beginner to front-end development find the code to be simpler? Why or why not?

Answer: Yes, a beginner would find it simpler to code because there is no need to install any software. It is a structural framework meant for dynamic web applications. There are tutorials through which one can use to create modules and controllers. One of them is shown on http://docs.angularjs.org/api 



3. How might the structure provided by AngularJS simplify building larger web applications?

Answer: Angular JS serves to minimize the size of the application into a Single Page Application. There are few functions in Angular JS where there is two-way data binding that eventually makes large portion of the code base disappear. Angular JS has controllers of various perspectives stacked on the page which helps to change/modify any specific part.
